# Comparing Classifiers

Our goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines).

We will use a dataset related to the marketing of bank products over the telephone.

The dataset we will use comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. The data is from a Portuguese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.

Solution Approach
- Understanding Data
- Exploratory Data Analysis
